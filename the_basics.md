# The Basics Part 0: Introduction

**The Basics** is a series of blog posts I'm writting in which I address the
most important topics that I consider to be basic knowledge in software
development.

A fair warning that this series might hurt some egos, but that's now what I'm
trying to do, I'm not trying to pass judgement, but rather share my opinion on
what **I** consider to be fundamental, this is ultimately an opinion, not a
statement of truth; you are free to disagree!

These are things that in, my opinion, anyone intending to write software
professionally should eventually learn, and are requirements for anyone wanting
to call themselves anything other but a Junior. If you don't have a firm grasp
over these concepts, you are essentially still a Junior developer.

The topics I'll be discussing in this series are, not necessarily in order:
* Software development and design principles
* Code Smells
* Design Patterns
* Refactoring Techniques
* Development tools
* Test-Driven Development
* Agile Software Development
* Continuous Integration
* Pair Programming

Of particular interest are the two last topics, which in the last years have
suffered from severe semantic drift, meaning that when most people talk about
these topics, they are not talking of the real, original meaning of Agile or CI,
but rather a confused and co-opted version of them.

If you know the real meaning of Agile and CI, and also have a firm grasp over
the other topics mentioned, you are either already a Senior software developer,
or are in a good path to becoming one.
